To run the ghost.js program, which automates interactions with multiple AI chat platforms using Puppeteer, the following requirements must be met:
Software Requirements
1.	Node.js: 
o	Version: 14.x or higher (due to modern JavaScript features like async/await and Puppeteer's compatibility).
o	Ensure Node.js is installed and accessible via the command line (node --version).
2.	npm: 
o	Comes bundled with Node.js.
o	Used to install dependencies listed in the package.json file.
3.	Puppeteer: 
o	The program requires the puppeteer package, a Node.js library for controlling headless Chrome/Chromium browsers.
o	Install via npm: npm install puppeteer.
o	Puppeteer automatically downloads a compatible version of Chromium during installation unless configured otherwise.
4.	Required Node.js Modules: 
o	readline: Built-in Node.js module for handling user input via the command line.
o	fs: Built-in Node.js module for file system operations (used for logging conversations).
o	These are part of Node.js core, so no additional installation is needed.
System Requirements
1.	Operating System: 
o	Compatible with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
o	The script uses a user data directory (./browser-data) to store browser profiles, so the system must support file system operations.
2.	Hardware: 
o	Memory: At least 4GB RAM (Puppeteer with multiple browser tabs can be memory-intensive).
o	Disk Space: ~1GB for Chromium (downloaded by Puppeteer) and additional space for logs and browser data.
o	CPU: Multi-core processor recommended for handling multiple browser instances.
3.	Internet Connection: 
o	A stable internet connection is required to load AI platforms (e.g., chat.openai.com, claude.ai, etc.) and for Puppeteer to download Chromium if not already installed.
Configuration Requirements
1.	User Accounts and Authentication: 
o	Valid accounts for the AI platforms used in the script: 
	ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com)
	Claude (https://claude.ai)
	Zeph (https://zeph.symboliccapital.net/)
	Copilot (https://copilot.microsoft.com/)
	Gemini (https://gemini.google.com/)
	Grok (https://grok.com/)
o	Users must manually log into these platforms when prompted during script execution, as the script does not handle authentication automatically.
2.	File System Permissions: 
o	Write permissions in the directory where the script runs to create: 
	./browser-data: Stores browser profiles for persistent sessions.
	./logs: Stores conversation logs in files named conversation_YYYY-MM-DD.txt.
3.	Directory Structure: 
o	The script creates a ./logs directory if it doesn’t exist for logging conversation data.
o	Ensure the script has write access to the working directory.
Dependency Installation
To set up the project, run the following command in the project directory:
bash
npm install puppeteer
This installs Puppeteer and its dependencies. No additional packages are explicitly required based on the script, as readline and fs are built-in.
Additional Notes
•	Headless Mode: The script runs Puppeteer in non-headless mode (headless: false) for visibility and manual login. Ensure a graphical environment is available if running on a desktop system, or modify the script for headless mode if running on a server.
•	Browser Data: The script uses a persistent user data directory (./browser-data) to maintain browser sessions, which may require manual cleanup if it grows large.
•	Platform URLs: The script assumes the listed URLs are correct and accessible. If any platform changes its URL or structure, the script may need updates to selectors or navigation logic.
•	Error Handling: The script includes error handling for navigation and selector issues but may require manual intervention if a platform’s UI changes significantly.
Optional Requirements
•	Prompt File: If using a custom session prompt file (as prompted in the startEasyInterface method), ensure the file exists and is readable. The script uses fs.readFileSync to load it.
•	Custom Timeout Configuration: The script uses platform-specific timeouts (e.g., 90s for Zeph, 60s for ChatGPT). Adjust these in the waitForResponse method if needed for your network conditions.
Example Setup Steps
1.	Install Node.js from nodejs.org if not already installed.
2.	Create a project directory and save ghost.js in it.
3.	Run npm init -y to create a package.json (optional but recommended).
4.	Install Puppeteer: npm install puppeteer.
5.	Ensure you have accounts for the AI platforms and can log in manually.
6.	Run the script: node ghost.js.
7.	Follow the prompts to log into each platform and configure the conversation.
If you encounter issues, verify Node.js version, internet connectivity, and platform accessibility. Let me know if you need help troubleshooting or setting up!
