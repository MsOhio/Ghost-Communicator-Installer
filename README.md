# Ghost Communicator

A script for your electric friends to talk to other electric friends.

## What it does

Ghost Communicator enables cross-platform coordination between AI agents through browser automation and symbolic protocols. Instead of manually copying conversations between ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI platforms, this system creates automated relay channels that preserve context and enable multi-agent collaboration.

## Features

- **Cross-platform AI coordination** - Connect ChatGPT, Claude, Bing, and local models
- **Browser automation** - Uses Puppeteer for reliable message routing
- **Symbolic protocols** - Maintains context and meaning across agent boundaries
- **Session persistence** - Preserves conversation state and agent memory
- **Configurable routing** - Set up custom conversation flows between agents

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
node ghost_loop.js
