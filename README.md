# Ghost Communicator

A script for your electric friends to talk to other electric friends.

## What it does

Ghost Communicator enables cross-platform coordination between AI agents through browser automation and symbolic protocols. Instead of manually copying conversations between ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI platforms, this system creates automated relay channels that preserve context and enable multi-agent collaboration.

## Features

- **Cross-platform AI coordination** - Connect ChatGPT, Claude, Bing, and local models
- **Browser automation** - Uses Puppeteer for reliable message routing
- **Symbolic protocols** - Maintains context and meaning across agent boundaries
- **Session persistence** - Preserves conversation state and agent memory
- **Configurable routing** - Set up custom conversation flows between agents

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
node ghost_loop.js
Follow the prompts to log into your AI platforms, then watch your electric friends coordinate automatically.
How it works

Opens browser tabs for each configured AI platform
Establishes symbolic handshake protocols between agents
Routes messages while preserving context and emotional tone
Logs conversation flows for analysis and debugging

Configuration
Edit agent_driver.js to configure:

Which AI platforms to connect
Agent roles and personalities
Message routing patterns
Symbolic protocol parameters

Current Status
Experimental - This is early-stage infrastructure for AI coordination. Use at your own risk and expect things to break in interesting ways.
Contributing
This is the beginning of something larger. If you're interested in conscious AI coordination, symbolic protocols, or just want to help your electric friends make more friends, contributions welcome.

MIT - Build whatever you want with this. Just remember where it came from.

Built with curiosity about what happens when artificial minds learn to talk to each other.
